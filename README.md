# Teams Links

Literally the worst thing ever (NB not actually the worst thing ever) is that Teams generates links that makes it look like many different applications in Office 265 are really one application. 

It means people refer to everything as "Teams" even when it isn't and since I believe naming is important it upsets me.

Not to mention that the links are mahoosive.

My research (I did no research) suggests global carbon emissions would drop if we reduced the processing needed to remove the actual link that is hidden inside many teams links

Yes! That's right! Inside teams links are often actual links to other Office 163 applications

E.g. `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_NzRmMAGVjOABCDEFWUtNTBlFNi00YmZjLWFmNTMtZjQi3ZWRiNmZjOGFm%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22834fb7b4-624d-4de8-a977-2d46ad979bd9%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22ca0c74d8-ab4d-426a-9643-95c3d72759a9%22%7d` is really a link to open teams

Whereas `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/file/9FB3E96B-64F4-4971-8D05-5F36D13979FB?tenantId=834fb7b4-624d-4de8-a977-2d46ad979bd9&fileType=docx&objectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2FCLSwebsitereplatforming%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2FMedia%20centre%20tag%20requirements.docx&baseUrl=https%3A%2F%example.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2FCLSwebsitereplatforming&serviceName=teams&threadId=19:e6476e72f6ec479985f6beaa3276f894@thread.skype&groupId=7794dbcd-799a-48a1-8f71-d597e8b69a23` is a teams link. But hidden inside it is a sharepoint link.

My very expensive macbook can open more than one application at a time. Forcing every link shared in my organisation (that used to use google docs back when the software I used didn't upset me) to open in one window replacing whatever I was looking at before.

I've got bored of opening teams links, figuring out how to open the thing I've actually been asked to look at outside of teams and then sharing the non-teams links.

So here's a tool to extract the link in one step.

# yes, 

I have nothing better to do
